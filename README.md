# Flappy Bird Challenge Game



## Introduction

This is a Flappy Bird challenge game built specifically for nOS and the NEO Blockchain.

In the game you can bet an amount of NEO on what score you are going to achieve. The profit percentage you achieve is based on the amount of score you pledge to achieve. The higher score you bet you can achieve, the higher the win percentage you will get. Example: you bet 100 NEO that you will achieve 100 points and you do. In such case, you win 1% on top of the 100 NEO, so you receive 101 NEO to your wallet. If you lose however, that profit percantage will be taken from your wallet.
